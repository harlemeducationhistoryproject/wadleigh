# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  exh: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: "exh_item" # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: "exh.csv" # path to the metadata file within `_data`
    images:
      source: "raw_images/exh" # path to the directory of images within `_data`
  audio: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: "oh_item" # the layout for the pages to use

# SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple search indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# an `index` file to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:search` .

search:
  main:
    index: "/search/index.json" # file the index will get written to
    collections:
      yb:
        content: true # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - label
          - creator
          - _tags
          - _date
          - source
          - schoolsub
      audio :
        content: true # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - label
          - _tags
          - _date
          - interviewer
          - narrator
