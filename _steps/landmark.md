The New York City Landmarks Commission gave Wadleigh historic landmark status in 1994. A network of Black women who had attended Wadleigh High School in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s lobbied local politicians and organized to secure this recognition for their school. For decades after they attended the school, their work included fundraising for school resources and for scholarship support for Wadleigh students. 

Their advocacy was one factor in securing a major renovation for the Wadleigh building from 1994 to 1997. The school was closed for construction in these years. [CHECK]
