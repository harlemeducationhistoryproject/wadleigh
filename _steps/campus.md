In the 1990s and 2000s, New York City divided many of its larger schools into smaller schools, or separate programs or houses within larger schools. Each smaller school or program offered its own focus area or theme, and students and families would choose which one suited them best.

Wadleigh was reconfigured into separate small schools as well. There were three schools, each with a special academic focus: writing and publishing, science and technology, and the arts. During the 1994-1997 renovation, these schools operated in temporary spaces. Then in 1997 they moved into the historic Wadleigh building.

The separate schools faced challenges in sustaining enrollment, and soon were combined into one secondary school.
