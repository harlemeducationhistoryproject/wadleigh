After being closed for two years for a renovation, the Wadleigh building reopened in the fall of 1954 as Wadleigh Junior High School (or JHS 88, later IS 88, in some records). The school served both boys and girls from Harlem.

Wadleigh's student population reflected the surrounding Harlem community. Most students were Black or Puerto Rican, and most were working class or poor.

New York City had a small proportion of Black teachers, but Wadleigh had several Black teachers who chose the school and stayed. After parent protest in the early 1970s, the Board of Education appointed Wadleigh's first Black principal, Ms. Elfreda Wright.

In the 1980s, Wadleigh's supporters advocated for long-overdue repairs to the increasingly decrepit building. They were successful in winning a major renovation in 1993, but it came alongside a major reorganization that effectively closed Wadleigh as a junior high school.
