Charter schools are funded with public dollars but managed by private organizations. Harlem's first charter school opened in 1999. It was created by educators working with Canaan Baptist Church and was named the Sisulu-Walker Charter School. That name honored Canaanâ€™s long-term pastor Wyatt Tee Walker, who had been a key figure in the US civil rights movment, and Walter Sisulu, who fought against apartheid in South Africa.

While Sisulu-Walker was deeply connected to Harlem institutions, many of the charter schools that developed in Harlem were controlled by organizations with few local roots. One of New York's largest charter networks opened a new charter school, Success Academy Harlem West Middle School, on the 4th floor of the Wadleigh building in 2012.

Success Academy periodically lobbied the Department of Education - which allocates school space - to have yet more room in the Wadleigh building. Their administrators argued that Wadleigh's small enrollment at the middle school level should lead to closure of part or all of the school, making space for Success Academy to expand.
