The Wadleigh History Project is a collaborative public digital history project to recognize, document, and teach the 120-year history of Black students, teachers, and community members at Harlem's Wadleigh High School (1902-1954), Wadleigh Junior High School (1954-1993), and Wadleigh Secondary School for the Performing and Visual Arts (1997-present).

_This is work in progress, most recently updated in August 2024_.
