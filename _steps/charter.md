Harlem’s first charter school opened in 1999. Charter schools are funded by public dollars but managed by private organizations, including organizations that operate many charter schools in New York City or across cities. One of New York’s largest charter networks, Success Academy Harlem West, opened as a middle school on the 5th floor of the Wadleigh building in 2012.
