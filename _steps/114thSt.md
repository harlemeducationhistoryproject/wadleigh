New York City's separate boroughs - Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island - consolidated to form a single city, and a single school system, in 1898. The consolidated city government planned a group of new high school buildings, including a new school for girls. Architect C.B. Snyder designed a new building for Wadleigh High School for Girls, and located it on a part of the block formed by 114th and 115th St, 7th Avenue, and 8th Avenue in Harlem. The neo-gothic building had an imposing tower and new innovations like an elevator and central ventilation.

Wadleigh High School for Girls opened in Harlem in the fall of 1902. Wadleigh moved to Harlem at the same time that many white middle-class New Yorkers were also moving uptown, following new subway lines to more spacious apartments. Many of them were families of recent or second-generation immigrants from Europe. Black New Yorkers, previously restricted by racism to a few downtown neighborhoods, began to move to Harlem when declining demand for its apartments by white people and Black real estate entrepreneurship opened the area to them beginning in 1905.

As Harlem’s Black population grew via migration within New York, from the US South, and the Caribbean, more Black students attended Wadleigh. The school was roughly one-third Black in 1931, but nearly 98% Black as of 1945. Many white residents had moved out of Harlem, and the Board of Education used zoning to make Wadleigh a predominantly Black school. 

Wadleigh’s enrollment declined over the 1940s and 1950s, and the Board of Education decided to close it as a girls high school in 1954.
