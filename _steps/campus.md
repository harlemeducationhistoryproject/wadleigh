In the 1990s and 2000s, New York City divided many of its larger high schools into smaller schools, or separate programs or houses within larger schools. Each smaller school or program offered its own focus area or theme, and students and families would choose which one suited them best. 

When Wadleigh opened after the 1997 renovation, students attended one of three separate houses within Wadleigh Secondary School: Scholars and Writers Academy, [arts?], and [math and science?]. 

Starting in 2004, two separate, fully independent schools operated within the Wadleigh building: Wadleigh Secondary School for the Visual and Performing Arts, and Frederick Douglass Academy II.
