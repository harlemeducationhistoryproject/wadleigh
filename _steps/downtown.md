New York City's first public high school for girls, called Girls High School, opened in 1897. That school occupied a building on East 12th Street in downtown Manhattan which previously had been the site of the 12th Street Advanced School for Girls, a private school founded by Lydia Wadleigh in 1856. In honor of Ms. Wadleigh's work in girls' education, the Board of Education of the City of New York renamed what had been called Girls High School to Wadleigh High School for Girls in 1900. 

When the 12th Street Advanced School for Girls opened, New York City operated its school on a racially segregated basis. Most likely, only white students attended that school. By 1897, when Girls High School opened, New York had renounced segregation as formal policy. We don't know if any Black girls attended that school.
